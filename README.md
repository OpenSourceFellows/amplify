# Amplify

Amplify is an open-source app created for users to take the initiative in being part of an actionable step in the efforts to protect against climate change. The user is able to choose a climate campaign, then using their zip code, they will be able to select a representative of their choice. The user then donates to have their letter sent out by Amplify
