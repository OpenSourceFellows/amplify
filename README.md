# amplify

## Getting Started

This repo contains both the frontend and backend portions of the Amplify application.

The frontend code is stored in the `src/` directory.

The backend (API) code is stored in the `server/` directory.

The repository uses Codespaces (Development Containers) to create a working development environment, enabling developers to open the project and start working immediately.

Would you like to become a contributor? Please check out our [contributors guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)! üíù 

Make sure to review the contributors guide to understand the development environment.

This repository supports [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) and VS Code [Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). If you are using Codespaces, the environment will be automatically provisioned and configured with a sample `.env` file. You will need to configure the keys in this file to enable the full functionality. Run `npm run dev` to launch a development server.

If you are developing locally using Visual Studio Code, you will need the **[Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)** extension. You should also meet the related Docker [System Requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements). Opening VS Code will prompt you to relaunch the environment in its fully configured container. This environment will have a sample `.env` file. You will need to configure the keys in this file to enable the full functionality.  Run `npm run dev` to launch a development server. **Note:** For Windows users, it is recommended that you use [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for best performance. To further improve performance, ensure the Git repo is cloned into a subfolder of the home (`~/`) directory.

We strongly encourage you to use one of these container solutions; however, if you want to develop locally without a container, you can manually configure your environment by running the included Bash script:

```shell
script/bootstrap
```
You will need to copy the `.env.example` file and create a `.env` file. This file will then need to be configured with additional keys to enable the full functionality.

## Using NPM
To configure the development environment and start the local application, you will need to use NPM. **Note**: you should run `npm run dev` to start the environment and initialize the pre-commit hooks required for contributing code.

### Compiles and hot-reloads full app for development
```shell
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```shell
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```shell
npm run lint
```

### Build and run as if in prod
```shell
npm start
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
