# Amplify

The Amplify is an open-source application designed to empower users to actively engage in the fight against climate change. It allows users to select relevant climate campaigns, locate political representatives based on their ZIP code, and send personalized letters to support these causes. The main goal of Amplify is to facilitate civic engagement by promoting concrete actions that create a positive impact in combating climate change. Developed by Program Equity, the project combines technology and community activism to create an accessible and effective platform for climate justice.
