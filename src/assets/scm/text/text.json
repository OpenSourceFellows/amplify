  "campaign_text": "Sogorea Te' calls on us all to heal and to do the work our ancestors and future generations are calling us to do. The West Berkeley Shellmound sacred site is more at risk than ever now that the property owner, a commercial real estate developer, holds an SB-35 permit and has taken additional steps towards development on the property.\n\nWhile the Shellmound hasn't been making headlines over the past year since the California Supreme Court denied our appeal, forcing Berkeley to issue a development permit, work has continued steadily to advocate for the sacred Ohlone heritage site.\n\nSmall Ohlone ceremonies and semi-public gatherings have been regularly held at the Shellmound, and a constant stream of messages of support, prayer ribbons and other offerings from community members have been affixed to the chain link fence surrounding the land. Conversations between local organizations, community leaders and elected officials are ongoing, regarding the fate of the Shellmound and what can be done.\n\nWhile there are various paths forward to achieving protection of the land, continued support from Berkeley City Councilmembers is critical at this moment. If you live in Berkeley, or elsewhere in the Bay Area, we ask that you please consider writing an email to, or otherwise reaching out to Berkeley Councilmembers (especially the representative of your district, if you live in Berkeley).",
  "supplemental_text": "Indigenous communities steward more than 80% of the world's biodiversity. Returning Shellmounds means endangered species like the Condor and Salmon can return, trees like the Madrone and Mugwort can return. Our strongest strategy towards lowering carbon emissions is Indigenous led conservation of biodiversity."
