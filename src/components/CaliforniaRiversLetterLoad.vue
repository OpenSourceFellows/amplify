          Dear {{ selectedRep.name }},
        </v-card-title>

        <v-card-text>
          <p class="text-left">
            Please accept these comments on the Draft Environmental Impact
            Statement for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water
            Project (SWP) Biological Opinion. For too long, these projects have
            diverted far too much water to Central Valley agriculture at a dire
            expense to the local watersheds, frontline communities, and
            struggling salmon populations. We cannot let this opportunity to
            rectify these harms be wasted by yet another default to this broken,
            and frankly racist, status quo. As you know, California's salmon and
            the communities that depend on them are facing an unprecedented
            crisis. Decades of operation under outdated BiOps and water laws
            have severely reduced salmon populations, leading to annual
            commercial fishing closures and the loss of access to this vital
            resource for many Native tribes. You have the chance now to rectify
            this. Unfortunately, though, the BOR’s Draft Environmental Impact
            Statement (DEIS) on the State and Federal water projects favors
            Alternative 2b, which relies heavily on vague, undefined, and
            generally ineffective Voluntary Agreements with California's largest
            water users and big ag. You can - and must - do better if our salmon
            are to have even a chance of recovery. Tribal outreach and
            engagement on an issue so central to these cultures has been paltry
            and even non-existent, especially with Tribes and marginalized
            communities in the Central Valley. This is in direct opposition to
            the Racial Equity Action plan approved by the State Water Board in
            2023 and the Bureau's Tribal Trust Responsibilities. Furthermore,
            the DEIS only focuses on the Klamath and Trinity River for Tribal
            Beneficial Uses (TBUs), when there are many more Tribes in the large
            expanse of the Central Valley that will be negatively affected by
            these projects. As many Tribal citizens, Intertribal organizations,
            and sportfishing community members have stated at virtual meetings
            and in-person hearings in Redding and Sacramento the past few weeks,
            Alternative 3 (Modified Natural Hydrograph), which protects
            fisheries and increases instream flows into the Delta, is the only
            alternative that meets the purpose and need of the BO. Currently the
            BOR prefers Alternative 2b. It is not a good alternative for the
            salmon and other native fish that are on the brink of extinction,
            and it is not legally defensible. It is also not a viable
            alternative for the Native people who depend on salmon for ceremony
            and sustenance, or the sportfishing community that depend on them
            for their livelihood.
          </p>

          <p class="text-left">
            Alternative 2b is also not economically feasible nor considerate of
            climate change and water supply issues. There is a higher solvency
            and return on investment of climate resilience with Alternative 3.
            Given both the Biden administration’s and Gov. Newsom's commitment
            to engaging Tribes - this would be a great opportunity to work with
            all communities across the North Delta, Sacramento River, and their
            tributaries to support flows for fish and fish-dependent
            communities, protect and restore Tribal Beneficial Uses, and support
            climate resiliency. Instead, the decisionmakers are leaning towards
            once again propping up unsustainable industrial agricultural profits
            at the expense of all other stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p class="text-left">
            Choosing Alternative 3 is critically important, as the Trump era
            Biological Opinion and Operations and use of Temporary Urgency
            Petitions have left salmon, and other species, on the brink of
            extinction and led to massive economic harm to coastal, salmon
            fishing, and recreational communities and industries. This
            industry-first management approach also threatens our rivers,
            drinking water supplies, and frontline communities, including
            Tribes. The alternative chosen for the CVP and SWP doesn't only
            affect our human relatives, but also our fish, mammal and plant
            relatives that depend on increased flows, colder temperatures and
            less water diversions to survive. Furthermore, your analysis has not
            yet taken a hard look at the cumulative impacts of the related Sites
            Reservoir and Delta Conveyance Project (Delta Tunnel), whose
            operations further threaten salmon habitats and could lead to their
            extinction in the Bay Delta and Central Valley watersheds. It is
            imperative that the BiOps prioritize better protecting instream
            flows and lower water temperatures to ensure the survival of salmon
            and the well-being of communities that rely on them. I implore you
            to choose Alternative 3 in the Long-term Operations of the State
            Water and Central Valley Projects. Thank you for your time and
            consideration.
